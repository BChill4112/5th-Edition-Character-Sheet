In this file I am going to put the things we need to include within the character sheet, we can break these down into who does what later if we want to and assign tasks. Each task can be put into its own branch and then added to the master when working and approved.
Feel free to add places or comments in this file. Once I get all the details for each class I will put tabs in this file to break it down so everyone has a quick reference.

****Also need to discuss if we want to put spells here or have a spot for people to just program them if at all (or a different app)
I would like to include a spot to keep track of spell slots, arrows, and sorcery points, maybe even a spot to determine wild surge?
Also to consider: Do we want to be able to export and save the file?
