Please comment to any changes you made, following with your name if you edit the master. Feel free to create branches to be approved to
add to the master to merge it with the final design. 
I am using Eclipse IDE and importing code from there, feel free to do the same. GitHub also has a desktop application if you would like to download it. 

Since this is a learning step for us if you are working on your own code to practice you can create a branch for review if you are stuck or want anyone else to look at your code.
